\Chapter{Inference with Normal Distributions}

When sampling distributions, bootstrap distributions, and randomization distributions are well approximated
by normal distributions, and when we have a way of computing the standard error, we can use normal distributions
to compute confidence intervals and p-values using the following general templates:

\begin{itemize} 
	\item confidence interval: 
		\[ 
		\mbox{statistic} \pm \mbox{critical value} \cdot  SE 
		\]

	\item hypothesis testing: 
		\[ 
		\mbox{test statistic} = \frac{ \mbox{statistic} - \mbox{null parameter}} { SE } 
		\]
\end{itemize} 

\section{Inference for One Proportion}

If we are working with one categorical variable, we can compute confidence intervals and p-values
using the following standard error formula:
\[
SE = \sqrt{ \frac{ p (1-p) } {n} }
\]
Actually that's not quite right.  We could use this if we new $p$ (the population proportion), but we never will.

Instead, we will use one of these approximations:
\begin{itemize}
	\item
		confidence intervals:  
		$ \displaystyle SE = \sqrt{ \frac{ \hat{p} (1-\hat p) } {n} }$

		We will estimate $p$ using our sample statistic $\hat p$.
	\item
		p-values:  
		$ \displaystyle SE = \sqrt{ \frac{ p_0 (1 - p_0) } {n} }$

		Since p-values are computed assuming $p = p_0$ (the null parameter), we should use $p_0$ 
		for computing $SE$.
\end{itemize}


The distributions will be close enough to normal for our purposes when
\[
p n \ge 10 and (1-p) n \ge 10
\;.
\]
(We'll check these using $\hat p$ or $p_0$.)


\subsection{Examples}

\subsubsection{Rock, Paper, Scissors}
	In a study to see whether people playing rock paper scissors are 
	equally likely to choose rock, paper, or scissors on their first 
	round, 119 people were observed.  66 of them chose rock.

	We can use this data to test the hypotheses:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $H_0$: $p = 1/3$
		\item $H_a$: $p \neq 1/3$
	\end{itemize}
	where $p$ is the proportion of people who start with rock.

	First we check that the normal approximation is good enough:

<<rock-paper-scissors, tidy=FALSE>>=
p.hat <- 66/119; p.hat
p.hat * 119               # check >= 10
(1 - p.hat) * 119         # check >= 10
SE <- sqrt( 1/3 * 2/3 / 119 ); SE
z <- (p.hat - 1/3) / SE; z
pnorm(z)                  # large side (rounded)
1 - pnorm(z)              # small side (less rounding)
2 * (1 - pnorm(z))        # p-value = 2 * small side
@

We hardly needed to compute a p-value in this case.  A test statistic of $z =
\Sexpr{round(z,2)}$ already tells us that the p-value will be quite small.

We can also compute a 95\% confidence interval for the proportion of people who start with rock:
<<tidy=FALSE>>=
p.hat                                          # same as above
1/3 * 119                                      # check >= 10
2/3 * 119                                      # check >= 10
SE <- sqrt( p.hat * (1 - p.hat) / 119 ); SE    # est. SE is (a little) different now
p.hat - 1.96 * SE                              # lower end of CI 
p.hat + 1.96 * SE                              # upper end of CI
@
If we want a different confidence level, we simply adjust the critical value.  Let's compute
a 98\% confidence interval.
<<tidy=FALSE>>=
z.star <- qnorm( 0.99 ); z.star                # critical value for 98% CI
p.hat <- 66/119; p.hat                         # same as above
SE <- sqrt( p.hat * (1 - p.hat) / 119 ); SE    # est. SE is (a little) different now
p.hat - z.star * SE                            # lower end of CI 
p.hat + z.star * SE                            # upper end of CI
@


\subsubsection{Pollination}
Many plants are capable of self-pollination.  To keep this from happening, some flowers 
come in left- and right-handed versions.  In left-handed plants, the pollen gets on the 
left sides of visiting bees.  In right-handed plants, pollen gets on the right sides of bees.
As the bees fly from flower to flower, the right-handed plants pollinate the left-handed plants,
and vice versa.

One genetic model suggests that there should be a 3:1 ratio of right-handed to left-handed flowers.
Scientists observed 6 right-handed and 21 right-handed flowers.  How is this data related to the 
conjecture of a simple Mendelian inheritance model?

We can test $H_0$: $p = 1/4$ against a two-sided alternative as follows:

<<tidy=FALSE>>=
p.hat <- 6/27; p.hat
Rand.Flowers <- do (1000) * rflip(27, .25)
histogram( ~prop, data=Rand.Flowers, width=1/27 )
prop( ~ (prop < p.hat), data=Rand.Flowers )        # one-sided p-value
2 * prop( ~ (prop < p.hat), data=Rand.Flowers )    # two-sided p-value
@
Notice that we need to be a bit cautious about 
using the normal distribution in this case since
$p_0 n < 10$:
<<>>=
27 * .25
@
Let's see how different the results are:
<<tidy=FALSE>>=
SE <- sqrt( 1/4 * 3/4 / 27 ); SE
z <- (p.hat - 1/4) / SE; z
pnorm(z)                                           # one-sided p-value
2 * pnorm(z)                                       # two-sided p-value
@

The approximation is not very good in this case (\Sexpr{2 * pnorm(z)} vs.
\Sexpr{2 * prop( ~ (prop < p.hat), data=Rand.Flowers ) }), but the conclusion
either way would be the same -- do not reject the null hypothesis. 
In this case, that means that the data are consistent with the null hypothesis.  But 
there is not a lot of data, and it may well be consistent with other hypotheses as well.

\subsubsection{Helper-Hinderer}
We all recognize the difference between naughty and nice, right? What about
children less than a year old -- do they recognize the difference and show a
preference for nice over naughty? In a study reported in the November 2007
issue of \emph{Nature}, researchers investigated whether infants take into account an
individual’s actions towards others in evaluating that individual as appealing
or aversive, perhaps laying for the foundation for social interaction.  In one
component of the study, 10-month-old infants were shown a “climber” character
(a piece of wood with eyes glued onto it) that could not make it up a
hill in two tries. Then they were alternately shown two scenarios for the
climber’s next try, one where the climber was pushed to the top of the hill by
another character (``helper") and one where the climber was pushed back down the
hill by another character (``hinderer"). The infant was alternately shown these
two scenarios several times. Then the child was presented with both pieces of
wood (the helper and the hinderer) and asked to pick one to play with. The
researchers found that the 14 of the 16 infants chose the helper over the
hinderer.

What can we conclude?  More of them chose the helper than the hinderer.  But maybe it was
just chance.  Maybe they just grab one of the toys and it has nothing to do with
whether or not they had seen the toys be helpful.

We can test
\begin{itemize}
	\item $H_0$: $p = 1/2$
	\item $H_a$: $p \neq 1/2$
\end{itemize}
to see whether 14 out of 16 is unusual enough to lead us to believe that the 
children are doing something other than guessing.

Once again, the normal approximation method might not be as accurate as 
we would like because the sample size is a bit small (but closer to our rule of
thumb than in the preceding example):
<<>>=
16 * 1/2                               # a bit too small
@
So let's do this two ways.  Once using the normal approximation and once using 
the randomization distribution and see how close the results are.

<<helper-hinder-norm, tidy=FALSE>>=
p.hat <- 14/16; p.hat
SE <- sqrt ( (1/2 * 1/2) / 16);  SE
z <- (p.hat - 1/2) / SE; z
pnorm(z)
2 * ( 1 - pnorm(z) )                   # p-value
@

<<helper-hinder-rand>>=
Rand.toys <- do(5000) * rflip(16, .5)
head(Rand.toys, 3)
2 * prop( ~(prop >= p.hat), data=Rand.toys )
histogram(~prop, data=Rand.toys, width=1/16)
@

In this case, the normal approximation is not so far off (which shouldn't surprise us too much
since 8 is not that far from 10), but we would expect that randomization p-value to be the 
more accurate one in this situation. 
In both cases the p-values are less than 0.05, so we can reject the null hypothesis (at the usual
$\alpha=0.05$ level) and conclude that the kids are not just guessing.


\subsection{Automating Everyting}

\R\ can automate the entire process for us.  Here are some examples.

\subsubsection{Pollination}
<<>>=
binom.test( 6, 27, p=0.25 )    # using an exact method
prop.test( 6, 27, p=0.25 )     # using normal approximation
@

The proportion test above uses a fancier version of the normal approximation (employing 
the so-called continuity correction, which usually makes it more accurate).  We can get
\R\ to do without this correction, and then the results will match ours above:
<<>>=
prop.test( 6, 27, p=0.5, correct=FALSE)
z^2                            # should match X-squared in the output above.
@

\subsubsection{Helper-Hinderer}
<<>>=
binom.test( 14, 16, p=0.5 )    # using an exact method
prop.test(  14, 16, p=0.5 )    # using normal approximation
@

The proportion test above uses a fancier version of the normal approximation (employing 
the so-called continuity correction, which usually makes it more accurate).  We can get
\R\ to do without this correction, and then the results will match ours above:
<<>>=
prop.test( 14, 16, p=0.5, correct=FALSE)
z^2                            # should match X-squared in the output above.
@

\subsection{Determining Sample Size}
An important part of designing a study is deciding how large the sample needs to be
for the intended purposes of the study.

\question
You have been asked to conduct a public opinion survey to determine what 
percentage of the residents of a city are in favor of the mayor's new deficit 
reduction efforts.  You need to have a margin of error of $\pm 3\%$.  How large
must your sample be?  (Assume a 95\% confidence interval.)

\answer
The margin of error will be $1.96 \sqrt{\frac{\hat p (1-\hat p)}{n}}$, so our method 
will be to make a reasonable guess about what $\hat p$ will be, and then determine how
large $n$ must be to make the margin of error small enough.

Since $SE$ is largest when $\hat p = 0.50$, one safe estimate for $\hat p$ is $0.50$, and 
that is what we will use unless we are quite sure that $p$ is close to $0$ or $1$.  (In
those latter cases, we will make a best guess, erring on the side of being too close to 
$0.50$ to avoid doing the work of getting a sample much larger than we need.)

We can solve $0.03 = \sqrt{ \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.5}{n}}$ algebraically, or we can play a
simple game of ``higher and lower'' until we get our value of $n$.  We could also
graph $\sqrt{ \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.5}{n}}$ and use the graph to estimate $n$.  Here's 
the ``higher/lower'' guessing method.
<<higher-lower>>=
1.96 * sqrt(.5 * .5 / 400)
1.96 * sqrt(.5 * .5 / 800)
1.96 * sqrt(.5 * .5 / 1200)
1.96 * sqrt(.5 * .5 / 1000)
1.96 * sqrt(.5 * .5 / 1100)
1.96 * sqrt(.5 * .5 / 1050)
@
So we need a sample size a bit larger than 1050, but not as large as 1100.  
We can continue this process to get a tighter estimate if we like:
<<higher-lower-b>>=
1.96 * sqrt(.5 * .5 / 1075)
1.96 * sqrt(.5 * .5 / 1065)
1.96 * sqrt(.5 * .5 / 1070)
1.96 * sqrt(.5 * .5 / 1068)
1.96 * sqrt(.5 * .5 / 1067)
@
We see that a sample of size 1067 is guaranteed to give us a margin of error of at most 
$3\%$.

It isn't really important to get this down to the nearest whole number, however.  Our goal
is to know roughly what size sample we need (tens? hundreds? thousands? tens of thousands?).
Knowing the answer to 2 significant figures is usually sufficient for planning purposes.

Side note:  The \R\ function \verb!uniroot! can automate this guessing for us, but it 
requires a bit of programming to use it:
<<uniroot>>=
# uniroot finds when a function is 0, so we need to build such a function;
# this function is 0 when the margin of error is 0.03:
f <- makeFun( 1.96 * sqrt(.5 * .5/ n) - 0.03  ~ n )  
# uniroot needs a function and a lower bound and upper bound to search between
uniroot( f, c(1,50000) )$root  
@

\subsubsection{Example}
\question
How would things change in the previous problem if 
\begin{enumerate}
\item
We wanted a 98\% confidence interval instead of a 95\% confidence interval?
\item
We wanted a 95\% confidence interval with a margin of error at most $0.5$\%?
\item
We wanted a 95\% confidence interval with a margin of error at most $0.5$\%
and we are pretty sure that $p < 10$\%?
\end{enumerate}

\answer
We'll use \verb!uniroot()! here.  
You should use the ``higher-lower'' method or algebra and compare your results.

<<sample-size-uniroot>>=
f1 <- makeFun( qnorm(.99) * sqrt(.5 * .5/ n) - 0.03 ~ n )
uniroot(f1, c(1,50000))$root
f2 <- makeFun( qnorm(.975) * sqrt(.5 * .5/ n) - 0.005 ~ n )
uniroot(f2, c(1,50000))$root
f3 <- makeFun( qnorm(.99) * sqrt(.1 * .9/ n) - 0.005 ~ n )
uniroot(f3, c(1,50000))$root
@


\section{Inference for One Mean}

If we are working with one quantitative variable, we can compute confidence intervals and p-values
using the following standard error formula:
\[
SE = \frac{\sigma}{ \sqrt{n}} 
\]
Once again, there is a small problem: we won't know $\sigma$.  So we will estimate $\sigma$ using our data:
\[
\displaystyle SE \approx \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
\]
Unfortunately, the distribution of 
\[
\frac{\mean x - \mu}{ s/\sqrt{n}}
\]
does not have a normal distribution.  Instead the distribution is a bit ``shorter and fatter" than the normal
distribution.  The correct distribution is called the t-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom. 
All t-distributions are symmetric and centered at zero.  The smaller the degrees of freedom, the shorter and fatter 
the t-distribution.


Using t-distributions, our templates for confidence intervals and p-values become the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item
		confidence intervals:  
		$ \displaystyle \mean{x} \pm  t_* SE$ where $SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt n}$ and $df=n-1$.

	\item
		p-values:  
		$ \displaystyle t = \frac{ \mean{x} - \mu_0}{ SE } $ where $SE = s/\sqrt{n}$ and $df=n-1$.
\end{itemize}

Here is some \R\ code related to t-tests and confidence intervals.

\subsection{The Long Way}

The test statistic for a null hypothesis of $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$ is 
\[
t = \frac{ \mean x - \mu_0}{ s/\sqrt{n}} = \frac{ \mbox{estimate} - \mbox{hypothesis value} }{\mbox{standard error} }
\]
This is easily computed in \RStudio:
<<temp1,tidy=FALSE>>=
# some ingredients
x.bar <- mean(~ BodyTemp, data=BodyTemp50); x.bar
sd <- sd (~ BodyTemp, data=BodyTemp50); sd
n <- nrow (BodyTemp50); n
se <- sd/sqrt(n); se
# test statistic
t <- ( x.bar - 98.6 ) / se; t
# 2-sided p-value
2 * pt( - abs(t), df=49 )
@

Similarly, we can compute a 95\% confidence interval
<<temp2>>=
t.star <- qt(.975, df=49); t.star
# lower limit
x.bar - t.star * se
# upper limit
x.bar + t.star * se
@

\subsection{Super Short Cuts}

Of course, \RStudio\ can do all of the calculations for you if you give it the raw data:
<<temp3>>=
t.test(~BodyTemp, data=BodyTemp50, mu=98.6)
@
You can also zoom in just the information you want:
<<temp4>>=
pval(t.test(~BodyTemp, data=BodyTemp50, mu=98.6))
confint(t.test(~BodyTemp, data=BodyTemp50))
@


\subsection{Sample Size Estimation}

Suppose we want to estimate the mean height of male Calvin students to within $\pm 1$ inch with 95\% confidence.
That is we want
\[
t_* SE = t_* \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = 1
\]
In order to determine our sample size, we will estimate $t_* \approx 2$ (this should be pretty close unless the 
require sample size is very small.)  We also need to come up with some estimate of hte standard deviation.
In this case, other data has been used to estimate the standard deviation of the heights of 18--25 year-old males
to be about 3 in.  If we assume that our population has a similar standard deviation, then we want
\[
2 \frac{3}{\sqrt{n}} = 1
\]
We can solve this pretty easily to show that $n = 6^2 = 36$.  So we need roughly 40 subjects to gain that
level of precision.  Again, the point is not to determine the exact number but to know roughly what size sample
will suffice.  

\subsection{The Central Limit Theorem and When These Approximations are Good Enough}

William Gosset proved that using $\displaystyle SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$ and the appropriate $t$-distribution
works perfectly when the population is exactly normally distributed.  But what happens when the population
is \emph{not} normally distributed?  An important theorem called the Central Limit Theorem says that 
as the sample sizes get larger and larger, the shape of the population distribution matters less and less.

The usual rule of thumb given is that
\begin{enumerate}
	\item When the population is normal, we can use these methods for any sample size.
	\item
		When the population is very nearly normal (unimodal and at most modestly skewed), 
		we can use these methods even for fairly small sample sizes.
	\item
		For most population distributions that occur in practice, sample sizes of $n \ge 30$ work 
		quite well.  (But see the next item.)
	\item
		Because outliers can substantially affect both the mean $\mean x$ and the standard deviation $s$, 
		outliers should be investigated.  If it is unclear why an unusual observation is in the data, 
		it may not be clear whether it should be removed or not, and the conclusions may differ substantially 
		with and without the outlier.
\end{enumerate}
As with all rules of thumb, the numbers given are guidelines.  Things always work better when the sample size
is larger and the population distribution is more like a normal distribution.  Unfortunately, when sample 
sizes are small, it is difficult to assess whether the population is normal.\footnote{Gossett offered 
the following advice: when the sample size is large, the population distribution doesn't matter, so use 
the t-distribution methods.  When the sample size is small, you won't be able to tell that the population
isn't normal, so use the t-distribution methods.

That's a little too cavalier with small samples.  But the method does work remarkably well in many
situations -- even situations where the sample sizes are modest.}

Tim Hesterberg (a statistician at Google) has argued that (1) this rule of thumb doesn't actually work very well, 
(2) there is a much better approach to deciding based on looking at the bootstrap distribution, and 
(3) it can be very difficult to tell how well things are working when sample sizes are very small.  For small
sample sizes, we really need to be convinced (for reasons other than our data) that the population should be 
expected to be approximately normally distributed.
